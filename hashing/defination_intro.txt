Hashing is define as making key and value pair of element in arrays to esly and fastly excess them 

                colligion 
            it occures when key of two element matchs with each other 
            Ther are two way of solving colligion 
        1. open chaing -> making linked list on that position of key
            
            ex-    1 ->20
                   2 ->30
                   3 ->40
                   5 ->34 ->68 ->54(handling colligion)
                   7 ->90
        2. Openaddressing -> use second arragument called probe number in hash funtion 


        Two type of hashing function in STL in C++

        1 -> map
        2 -> unordered_map
